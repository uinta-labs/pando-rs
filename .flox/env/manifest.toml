# The `hook.on-activate` script is run by the *bash* shell immediately upon
# activating an environment, and will not be invoked if Flox detects that the
# environment has previously been activated. Variables set by the script will
# be inherited by `[profile]` scripts defined below. Note that any stdout
# generated by the script will be redirected to stderr.

# Scripts defined in the `[profile]` section are *sourced* by *your shell* and
# inherit environment variables set in the `[vars]` section and by `[hook]` scripts.
# The `profile.common` script is sourced by all shells and special care should be
# taken to ensure compatibility with all shells, after which exactly one of
# `profile.{bash,fish,tcsh,zsh}` is sourced by the corresponding shell.

# The `[services]` section of the manifest allows you to define services.
